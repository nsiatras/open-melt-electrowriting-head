# Open-Source Melt Electrowriting (MEW) Head

This repository presents an **open-source Melt Electrowriting (MEW) head**, designed with a clear focus on **accessibility, affordability, and ease of manufacturing** for research laboratories and academic institutions worldwide.

The primary goal of this design is to enable **low-cost fabrication** without compromising functionality or safety. To achieve this, the MEW head is built using **simple, widely available materials** and was designed entirely with **DesignSpark Mechanical** by RS Electronics—a free, reliable, and accessible CAD tool.
