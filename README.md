# Open Source Melt Electrowriting (MEW) Head

This is my Open Source Melt Electrowriting (MEW) Head. I designed this MEW Head in order to be able to be manufactured easily and above all economically by research centers around the world. To achieve this I used simple and cheap materials while I used the most economical and reliable CAD software I could find, the DesignSpark Mechanical made by RS Electronics.

It can withstand a load of 12,000Volt and 120°C. It uses a 5cc clear syringe barrel made by Nordson and SL-015-AL-15 Ceramic Aluminium Oxide Thermal Pads.

## Bill of materials
For the main body of the MEW head you can use aluminum like 5083 and 6061. The outer jacket is made from Peek. Peek is quite expensive material and you might need to use a cheaper alternative like Teflon.
